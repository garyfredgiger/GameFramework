GameFramework
=============

A Java based game framework on which I am working. This is a pet project of mine to see if I can develop an easy to use game framework for myself and others to use to create classic 2D arcade games. This version of the game framework appears to be stable and I have used it to create one game, a clone of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The GitHub repo for this game can be viewed *[here](https://github.com/garyfredgiger/SpaceInvadersClone.git)*. As I get more time, I plan on using this game framework to develop additional classic arcade games including an Asteroids clone, a Robotron clone and a Pac-Man style clone.

Long Term Goals:

<ul>
<li>Add a simple Ackerman Steering vehicle model so developers can create racing and other games involving vehicles.</li>
<li>AI behaviors so game entities can employ Seek, Flee, Arrive, Pursuit, Evade and Wander behaviors to make games more interesting and challenging.</li>
<li>Possibly add some type of network capability to enable two or more players can play together or compete.</li>
</ul>

If you are looking for a more complete Java Game library to develop your own games, check out the project *[Lightweight Java Game Library](http://lwjgl.org/)* and *[JGame](http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/)*.

NOTE: I included the eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) in this project so you can simply import this project without having to create a new project from your cloned copy of the code. Some suggest it is not a good idea to include project specific files, but I thought I would be a rebel and do it anyway.

This project was developed using Eclipse Kepler Release (Build id: 20130614-0229) with Java 1.6.

Note: If you are new to Eclipse and need instructions on how to install and set it up, refer to this link *[here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation)*.
